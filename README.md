What this project should solve ?
Often times you work on production project, and want to test
some packages, patterns, or any other thing on other smaller
project with different frameworks, setups, etc.
This project should act as a constructor for you/me, and give you
an easy way to add something or remove something, without pain, so you can test things quickly.
